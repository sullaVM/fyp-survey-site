    </h1>
    A perceptual study on a virtual human model.
  </div>

  <h2>
    Meet Tatiana â€” she's a virtual human rendered in Unreal Engine 4.
  </h2>

  <div id="intro">
    <p>In this survey, you are asked to compare Tatiana's photorealism
      in different rendering qualities. Each image is labelled Quality A and Quality B.
      We'd like to know if you think the image Quality A is less realistic, the same
      or more realistic than Quality B. Quality A will always be on the left-hand side
      and Quality B on the right-hand side.
    </p>

    <p>No personal data will be collected at any point of this survey.</p>

    <p>This survey works on mobile but if possible, please take this survey on a laptop/desktop.</p>
